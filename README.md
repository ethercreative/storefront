# Storefront
Easily integrate Shopify with Craft CMS!

### TODO
#### MVP
- [ ] Dynamically create / remove entries based on Shopify products (entries disabled by default)
- [ ] Dynamically create / remove categories based on Shopify collections (categories disabled by default)
- [ ] Show a snippet of the product in a custom field in the entry (use this custom field to get shopify product data)
- [ ] Add twig tags / endpoints to show / update the Shopify "checkouts" (carts)
- [ ] Tie craft users to Shopify customers (SSO?)

#### Nice to have
- [ ] Allow basic editing of Shopify products in craft (i.e. title)
